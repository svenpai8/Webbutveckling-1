<p>Our Fortnite Beginner's Guide will get you started in this popular f2p game. This guide includes beginner's information on gun rarity, guns, healing, building, and finding loot. We also go through each phase of the game so you will know how to approach the early, mid, and late game stages of Battle Royale!

Fortnite can be a tough game to fully grasp early on when you are just starting out. You have to adapt to the gunplay, but the biggest thing you'll need to wrap your head around is the building. If you have just picked up the game, I would focus more on learning how to shoot straight and then slowly start integrating building into the game. If you want to work on getting a grasp on building, there's a mode called "Playground" where you can jump into a game by yourself and get a feel for the controls.

If you have any technical questions, Fortnite has a pretty large help database which you can find on their site!

WHAT IS FORTNITE?
If you aren't even really familiar with the concept of Fortnite then let me break it down a bit for you. Fortnite is a Battle Royale game. You might be familiar with this concept even if you've never played games before due to it borrowing heavily from The Hunger Games books/movies. The idea is that you are let loose on an island with a bunch of other players, your task is to survive and come out on top. This isn't going to be easy, because not only do you have all of the other people on the map trying to eliminate you, you also have a circle of death approaching you from all sides. This circle, called "the storm" in Fortnite, will deal damage to you if you stand in it. It continues to periodically close in on you until one player is left standing.

That sounds fairly daunting, but there's things you'll find on the map to help you. Weapons are scattered everywhere and you can equip yourself with them to defend yourself, you can find bandage and shields to protect you from damage!

ITEM RARITY
If you've ever played Diablo or World of Warcraft you'll be fairly familiar to rarity colors. Each color denotes the rarity of the particular item, and the more rare means the better it is. This is no different in Fortnite, each gun has a rarity assigned to it, however, one of the unique things about Fortnite is that some guns start in the middle of the rarity tier or don't make it to the end of it. Here's a list of the rarities available, as well as how they stack up against each from Weakest to Strongest:

Common (Gray) > Uncommon (Green) > Rare (Blue) > Epic (Purple) > Legendary (Orange)

When it comes to guns, if it's a higher rarity it does more damage for that particular type of gun.

Keep in mind that all items have a rarity assigned to them. This includes items that heal you (Bandages, Medkits) as well as traps and grenades. These types of items only come in one rarity, so there's no version that is better than another. </p>
